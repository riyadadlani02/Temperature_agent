# Temperature_agent
The Temperature Alert Agent is a versatile Python script built using the uAgent library, designed to provide real-time temperature monitoring and alerts based on user-defined temperature thresholds and location preferences.

Features



Real-time Temperature Monitoring: The Temperature Alert Agent connects to a free weather API, ensuring that users receive up-to-the-minute temperature data for their chosen location.

User-Defined Temperature Range: Users can specify their preferred temperature range by setting both minimum and maximum thresholds.

Location Flexibility: Users can configure the agent to monitor temperature data for their specific location, be it a city, coordinates, or any place supported by the chosen weather API.

Instant Notifications: The agent sends instant alerts or notifications to users whenever the current temperature falls below the minimum or exceeds the maximum threshold they've set.

Why Use the Temperature Alert Agent?




Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on temperature changes in your preferred location, ensuring you're always informed about temperature variations that matter to you.

Customizable Alerts: Set your desired temperature thresholds to match your preferences and receive alerts tailored to your needs.

Versatile Location Options: Whether you're interested in monitoring your hometown, a vacation destination, or any location supported by the weather API, the agent provides flexibility.

Easy Integration: The agent is easy to integrate into your own projects or automation systems.


To get started with the Temperature Alert Agent, simply follow the installation and usage instructions provided in the README.md file.



Installation




Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/temperature_agent.git



Navigate to the project directory:
cd temperature_agent



Install the required dependencies:
pip install requests



Usage





Open the temperatureagent.py file.

Set your preferred parameters:

api_key: f"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={location}&appid={API_KEY}"
min_temperature: The minimum temperature threshold that triggers an alert.
max_temperature: The maximum temperature threshold that triggers an alert.
Save the changes.




Run the script:



python temperatureagent.py
The Temperature Alert Agent will start running and periodically fetch the current temperature for your specified location.

You will receive an alert/notification when the current temperature falls below the set minimum or exceeds the maximum threshold.



Configuration



You can modify the configuration in temperatureagent.py to suit your preferences and needs. You can adjust the frequency of temperature checks, the method of alert/notification (e.g., email, SMS), and more.
